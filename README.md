## Description
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application is designed to be used by a small business owner in order to be able to write and save notes to organize thoughts and tasks they might need to keep track of or complete.

Visit the application at [secure-oasis-34180.herokuapp.com](https://secure-oasis-34180.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

    npm i
## Usage
Clicking on the link to the notes page presents a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and note text in the right-hand column. Notes must be saved with save button after the user has finished typing their title and note text. Clicking on an older note in the left-hand column causes that note to appear in the right-hand column, and of course clicking the pen icon button presents empty fields to enter a new note title and the note text.
